The export IdCardLanyard was not found in module [project]/Desktop/react/sgi/node_modules/lucide-react/dist/esm/lucide-react.js [app-client] (ecmascript).
Did you mean to import IdCard?
All exports of the module are statically known (It doesn't have dynamic exports). So it's known statically that the requested export doesn't exist.

Did you mean to import Shield?
All exports of the module are statically known (It doesn't have dynamic exports). So it's known statically that the requested export doesn't exist.
